### Parts to be manufactured

to make a single unit:

- (x1) Clippard 8-MC cover
- (x1) Clippard 8-MC heart

<br>

#### updates for version 2:
- **Clippard 8-MC cover**
    - Slightly different location of PCB mounting holes
- **Clippard 8-MC heart**
    - Removed bottom depression, outlet changed from a male thread to an NResearch (1/4-28) female hole (matches the vial inlet holes)
    - Odor (vial) inlet ID changed
    - Odor input hole (from the bottom) was previously not aligned with its connecting inlet hole (horizontal) - tied geometries together

## Electronics

To be used with 8-line Olfactometer PCB (MAIN_CNTRL_v02).

## Hardware

### Clippard 8-MC heart (v2A) inner tubing dimensions

1/32" ID where NResearch fittings connect (odor in, exhaust)  
3/64" ID for the rest of it (clean air in, valve outlet)

### Changes from v1 to v2:

#### Clippard 8-MC heart:
- Odor input hole (from the bottom) was previously not aligned with its connecting inlet hole (horizontal) - tied geometries together  
	- (x_Clippard 8-MC heart v50 v3 shows the initial error)  
	- (Clippard 8-MC heart_v01 has some fixed things in it)  
- Odor (vial) inlet ID changed from .046" to .03125" (1/32") (to match 1/32" ID tubing)  

#### Clippard 8-MC cover:
- PCB mounting holes: just picked a dimension since it seems last time it was made up
